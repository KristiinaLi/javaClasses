## Creating different methods
// class can define anything you wish: public class guitar, public class giraffe
// only one Main class per file "public class Main"
// this is an entry point for the program

// I might want to add my own custom method
// I can do that by adding a new method
// I don't have to add it, but I can
// What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas = What happens in this method, stays in this method. 
// Other methods don't see what's going on in there. 
// If you define a scanner in one method, it can't be used in another method.
// In order to share a scanner between methods, you have to declare it in class, before the first method.

## Indentation in Java to keep the code clean and readable for people
// If you mess up your indentation and get lost, you can ask ChatGPT to fix your indentation without changing the code and she will do it for you.
// There is a small arrow on the left, to collapse parts of the code (per scope) for easier readability

## Break down a problem into smaller parts
// make notes
