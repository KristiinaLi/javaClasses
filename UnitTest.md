# UnitTest

### Standardized
1. Repeatable / consistent - should be able to pass in different circumstances
2. Independancy / isolated - 4, 1, 3, 2, 5; one test should not be deoendant on other tests, the order shouldn't matter, should run on it's own.
3. Test one thing - Unit test is supposed to test the smallest unit of the program. 
4. Should follow general programming guidelines/patterns - SHould have consistent structure of unit tests (e.g. GivenWhenThen; Arrange, Act, Assert)
5. The more tests you have, the better, but you don't want to have a test for every day of the week (when checking dates for weekdays)

- @Test is an attribute
- TDD TestDrivenDevelopment - writing UnitTest to brake the current method. 
- Code coverage - 70% tested / 30% not tested - testing  every method of every class of every module of every package. You can ask ChatGPT to write your unit tests for you.
